# Philosopher AI demo

This is an isolated script you can run, which executes the same core functionality as what you see on https://philosopherai.com

## Wait a minute... This is really short?!?

What made Philosopher AI work as well as it does is not the result of complex programming: it's the result of a lot of tinkering with certain details to get the balance *just right*.

Feel free to explore what those are on your own :)

## How to run the script

First, enter your OpenAI credentials at the top of the file `philosopher_demo.js`.

`npm install`

`node philosopher_demo.js`
